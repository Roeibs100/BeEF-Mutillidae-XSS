# Incident Report: BeEF XSS via Mutillidae

## Overview
A stored XSS vulnerability in Mutillidae was used to hook a browser with BeEF. The attacker then issued multiple client-side commands.

## Timeline
- **11:00** - BeEF launched on Kali Linux
- **11:03** - XSS payload injected into Mutillidae (Stored XSS)
- **11:05** - Victim accessed the vulnerable page, BeEF hook activated
- **11:06** - BeEF commands executed (alert box, keylogger, internal port scan)

## Actions Taken
- Alert box triggered in victim browser
- JavaScript keylogger activated
- Attempted scan of internal IP range
- Cookie harvesting module loaded

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Outgoing request to `/hook.js`
- Suspicious JavaScript execution patterns
- Presence of BeEF command modules in network activity
- Unknown popups and JavaScript prompts

## Recommendations
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Disable inline scripts where possible
- Use browser security extensions (NoScript, uBlock Origin)

## Conclusion
This simulation demonstrates the risk posed by XSS vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited to gain control over a client browser using BeEF. Proper mitigation techniques can significantly reduce the attack surface.
